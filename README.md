100 days of pUshup code

A personal project taken by me and later on developed into a app to guide other people on a journey of 100 days of pushup.

App is simple. You register on day 0 and for next 100 days you will get a target. Once you have completed the pushup, you register the count to a common leaderboard 
which opens up the output on a website.

Any suggestions / help would be helpful
